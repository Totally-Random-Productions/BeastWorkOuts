# BeastWorkOuts
A Gym routine app for the modern gym junkie. 

##Problem Statement: 
Working out or participating in various forms of physical exercise is an important part of staying healthy. It is also a key focus of both the Physical Education Curriculum and  Sports training. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, coaches and physical educators are being affected by the lack of physical interaction and need for social distancing with their students. Lecturers at the University of the West Indies (UWI) are especially concerned about how best to incorporate the required physical workouts for their students.
